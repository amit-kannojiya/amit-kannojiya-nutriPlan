## Overview
What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

-This app focuses on daily dietary planning based on an individual's Body Mass Index (BMI) and any existing lifestyle diseases. Users can customize their daily intake depending on their body's unique needs, ensuring a personalized approach to nutrition and health.

### Problem
Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

-I feel like there are many option related to same concern but something that plan your diet depending on lifestyle disease are may be few or none.

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.
-NutriPlan caters to individuals dealing with lifestyle diseases, offering an intuitive platform to tailor daily meals according to their BMI. It prioritizes user accessibility, a friendly interface, and robust security for safeguarding sensitive health information.


### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

-this would have sign up page for individual seeking diet ,a form that will record user input in reagrds to once needs, customize receipe icons.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

In creating NutriPlan, I might use user-friendly tools like React for the interface, Node.js and Express for the server-side, and a database (e.g., mySQL) for storing user data. To secure user authentication, we could consider tools like JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Always exploring options to enhance the user experience and data security.
### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.
NutriPlan will integrate the Edamam API,will look for more so far only this i know
### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

Home:Landing page with an overview of NutriPlan's features and benefits.

BMI Calculator:Allows users to input weight and height for the app to calculate their Body Mass.

Profile:User-specific page where individuals can input and update personal information,

Meal Planner:Central page for creating and customizing daily meal plans based on BMI.

Nutrition Insights:Offers educational content and insights into nutrition.

Progress Tracker:Displays users' progress over time.

Settings:Allows users to customize app preferences.

Privacy and Security:

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.
-my sketch is not ready yet.

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between them. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out. 
User Data: Includes personal information such as name, age, gender, weight, height, BMI, health goals, dietary preferences, and lifestyle diseases.

Meal Plans: Comprise data on customized daily meal plans, including food items, portion sizes, and nutritional information.

Progress Tracking: Records user progress over time, such as weight changes, adherence to meal plans, and other relevant metrics.

Authentication Data: Manages user login credentials securely, potentially utilizing tools like JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

External Data (Edamam API):

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

i am not sure about the endpoint yet

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

-Authorization:
Access to certain endpoints (e.g., profile updates, meal planning) is restricted to authenticated users.
User roles may be implemented to manage authorization levels (e.g., regular user, admin).

Profile Functionality:
Users have a dedicated profile where personal details, health goals, and dietary preferences are stored.
Profile updates require authentication to ensure data security.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.
Day 1-2:
Define project requirements and features.
Choose technologies (React, Node.js, mySQL).
Set up the development environment.
Day 3-4:
Implement user registration and login functionality.
Set up JWT for secure authentication.
Day 5-7:
Create user profile endpoints (GET, PUT).
Conduct initial testing of authentication and profile features.
Week 2: BMI Calculation, Meal Planning, and Testing

Day 8-9:
Develop the BMI calculation endpoint.
Design and begin implementation of meal planning functionality.
Day 10-11:
Continue meal planning implementation, integrating the Edamam API for nutritional data.
Day 12-13:
Implement progress tracking functionality.
Conduct thorough testing for functionality and security.
Day 14:
Finalize testing, address any issues discovered.
Deploy the application to a hosting environment.
